## âš¡ LineFollowerRobot

**LineFollowerRobot** is a high-speed line following robot designed for competitive racing on black-line tracks. Built with a lightweight chassis and a precise analog sensor array, this project balances speed, stability, and responsivenessâ€”perfect for robotics enthusiasts, engineering students, and DIY competitors.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications

* **Microcontroller**: [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano) â€” the robot's brain, handling sensor input and motor control in real time.
* **Line Sensor**: [Pololu QTR-8A Analog Reflectance Sensor Array](https://www.pololu.com/product/960) â€” 8 analog channels for high-resolution line tracking.
* **Motors**: [Pololu Micro Metal Gearmotor 10:1 HP](https://www.pololu.com/product/1093) â€” high-speed motors for rapid and accurate path following.
* **Motor Driver**: [TB6612FNG Dual H-Bridge Driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14451) â€” efficient motor control with independent direction and PWM speed regulation.
* **Chassis**: Lightweight and low-profile, optimized for maneuverability and high-speed cornering.

### ðŸ§  Features

* High-speed line tracking with analog sensor precision.
* PID or proportional-only control (tunable).
* Modular code structure for easy adjustments and upgrades.
* Designed for maximum performance on standard competition tracks.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
